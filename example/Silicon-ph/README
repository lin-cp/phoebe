# To run the full tutorial, generate the anharmonic force constants
# using either thirdorder.py-anharmonic or phono3py-anharmonic first.
# To just quickly try out a transport calculation, use the data at
# in phoebe/test/data/phono3py/, which can be used immediately in
# these .in files
#
# Just make sure you point the .in files to whatever anharnonic data you generate!
